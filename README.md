# MD4IoT-Health-Check
Scripts to check the system health of MD4Iot Sensors via ping and ssh conectivity and subsequent commands

Credentials should be stored in a .json format such as in the example file in this repo
The best practice would then be to encrypt it and store the resulting key in a safe place

sensorHealth.py is a compliation of all scripts into a full fledged (currently not working) application
